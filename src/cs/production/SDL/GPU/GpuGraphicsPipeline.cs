///     <para>
///         Some stages are programmed using shaders, others have fixed or configurable behavior. The five main stages
///         of the pipeline in-order include: the per-vertex shading stage, the rasterization stage, depth-test stage,
///         stencil-test stage, and the per-fragment (per-pixel) shading stage. The per-vertex shading stage and
///         per-fragment (per-pixel) shading stage are programmable. The rasterization stage, depth-test stage, and
///         stencil-test stages are fixed but configurable. Remaining other stages are hidden from the perspective of
///         the developer as they are fixed and non-configurable.
